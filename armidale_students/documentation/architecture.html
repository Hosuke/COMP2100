  <h1>The armidale architecture</h1>

    <p class=redNote>
      A technical conference paper is being written (March 2002) to describe the armidale architecture.
      So, for now the following notes and a commented sample application are provided to help developers
      understand the overall structure of the armidale system.
    </p>
    
    <h2>armidale applications</h2>
    
      <a name="init"/>

      <p class=L2><font class=arm>armidale</font> applications are simply classes that extend the 
      <font class=code>armidale.api.Application</font> class and provide an implementation for the
      inherited <font class=code>init()</font> method.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L2>The <b>init()</b> method is the "main" method of an <font class=arm>armidale</font> application.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L2>User interfaces are created using the <font class=code>armidale.api.gui.*</font> API. This API
      provides a set of GUI object factories which create instances of classes that implement
      specific GUI objects interfaces. For example, the <font class=code>armidale.api.gui.PushButtonFactory</font>
      creates instances of classes that implement the <font class=code>armidale.api.gui.PushButton</font>
      interface. The particular implementation returned by a factory depends on the context in
      which the application is running.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L2>If the application is running in a local context (ie. no internet or intranet involved),
      then the factory will create an implementation that displays a PushButton on the local machine
      (using platform specific widgets such as Java Swing).
      </p>
      
      <p class=L2>If, on the other hand, the application is being run by an <font class=arm>armidale</font> server 
      in response to a client request via the internet or intranet, the factory will create an implementation that
      sends messages to the client directing it to display a PushButton on the clients computer.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L2>Application developers do not need to concern themselves with the context in which their
      applications will be used. They simply write their applications using the <font class=arm>armidale</font>
      API as if they were stand-alone programs.
      </p>
      
    <h2>The armidale GUI API</h2>
    
      <p class=L2>The <font class=arm>armidale</font> GUI API implements a rich set of GUI objects including frames, buttons, lists,
      images, etc. In most cases, the objects operate in way similar to their corresponding swing widget. One exception 
      is the way in which <font class=arm>armidale</font> manages panels.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L2>In <font class=arm>armidale</font>, there are a range of panels. Each panel has a fixed layout manager
      (eg. BorderPanel, BoxPanel, GridPanel, FlowPanel, SplitPanel etc.). Any widget (including other panels) can
      be located on an <font class=arm>armidale</font> panel. This approach contrasts with Swing where the layout
      of widgets on a panel is managed by a separate layout manager which can be changed at any time.
      </p>
      
    <h2>Client-Server operation</h2>
   
      <h3>The connection</h3>
      
      <p class=L3>The <font class=arm>armidale</font> server (<font class=code>armidale.api.Server</font>) is a
      very simple Java program. It listens on a specified port for TCP/IP connections from clients. All clients,
      including the <font class=arm>armidale launcher</font>, make use of the 
      <font class=code>armidale.api.RemoteApplication</font> class to start applications on remote
      <font class=arm>armidale</font> servers. This class is instantiated with the URL of a remote application and
      any required arguments. When an instance
      of this class is created, it sends a CONNECT message to the server containing the name of the application the
      client wants to run and the list of arguments. This application name is in fact the name of a Java class that
      extends <font class=code>armidale.api.Application</font>, is installed on the server computer, and is visible
      to the <font class=arm>armidale</font> server (ie. on its class path).
      </p>
      
      <p class=L3>When a server receives a CONNECT message from a client, it creates a server context associated with the
      requesting client that contains details of the connection and an object registry used to track objects
      distributed across the connection. This context is then used to create an instance of the requested application
      class. If everything is OK, a CLASS_INFORMATION message is sent back to the client specifying any special
      requirements the application may have (such as non-standard widgets). If a problem occurs on the server (such as
      a missing application class), an ERROR message is returned to the client.
      </p>

      <p class=L3>When the client receives the CLASS_INFORMATION message it checks that it is able to satisfy the needs of the 
      remote application (eg. availability of any special widgets). If all is well, the client will send a CLIENT_OK message
      to the server.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L3>When the server receives the CLIENT_OK message, it calls the <font class=code>start()</font>
      method of the requested application instance (which is a Java Thread). When the application is started,
      the <font class=code>init()</font> method (described <a href="#init">above</a>)
      is called. The <font class=code>init()</font> method, defined by the application developer, will usually create 
      a user interface and set up callbacks. The application then waits for and processes EVENT messages from the client.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Object Creation</h3>
      
      <p class=L3>When an application creates a new GUI object such as a PushButton (using the PushButtonFactory), the server
      implementation of the object sends a CONSTRUCT message to the client. When the client receives a CONSTRUCT message
      it uses the applicable widget factory to create a instance of the required class within the client context.
      These client implementations have a unique identifier (registered with the context object registry) and an
      associated instance of the class within a platform context (eg. swing). These platform context objects
      display the GUI widgets on the client computer.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Changing Object Attributes</h3>
      
      <p class=L3>When an application modifies an attribute of a GUI object, such as the title of a PushButton, the server implementation
      of the object sends a SET_ATTRIBUTE message to the client. When the client receives a SET_ATTRIBUTE message, it dispatches it to
      the applicable object for processing.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Callbacks and Events</h3>
      
      <p class=L3>Many of the GUI widgets supported by <font class=arm>armidale</font> are capable of generating events. PushButtons, 
      for example, are able to generate ACTION events. Events are handled in <font class=arm>armidale</font> by callbacks.
      Callbacks are classes which define methods that are called when an event is generated by a widget. These callback
      classes are extended by the application programmer to define the required response to events and are registered
      with a widget of interest.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L3>When a client event occurs (eg. the user clicks a PushButton), an EVENT message is sent to the application
      running on the server. When the server receives an EVENT message it is dispatched to the associated object for processing. 
      When an object receives an EVENT message it calls the applicable method in each of the callbacks registered with it.</p>
      
      <p class=L3>Event messages are only sent from the client to the server if one or more callbacks are
      registered with the subject widget.
      </p>
      
      <a name="filesystem"/>
      <h3>Image handling</h3>
      
      <p class=L3>When an application creates an <b>Image</b> object a CONSTRUCT message is sent to the client and processed in the 
      normal way. No image data is involved at this stage. The application can then set the image data by calling 
      the <b>setImageData()</b> or <b>setFile()</b> methods.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L3>When the <b>setImageData()</b> method is used, image data is simply sent to the client
      and displayed as required.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L3>A more efficient approach is to use the <b>setFile()</b> method which takes the name
      of a file in the <font class=arm>armidale</font> filesystem. This filesystem is simply a directory within the users home
      directory called <b>.armidale/filesystem</b> and is created during the <a href="userinstall.html">user
      installation process</a>. When the <b>setFile()</b> method is used, the name of the file and its date-time stamp are
      sent to the client. When the client receives such a message, it attempts to open a file with the same name 
      in its local <font class=arm>armidale</font> filesystem. If the file exists on the client and has the same
      date-time stamp, the image is displayed as required. 
      </p>
      
      <p class=L3>If the required file does not exist in the client's filesystem, or the date-time stamp is incorrect, then
      the client will request a copy of the file from the server. The server will then send the file to the client,
      and it will be saved on the client's <font class=arm>armidale</font> filesystem. The contents of
      the file are then displayed in the normal way.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L3>The above approach implements a simple, but effective image cache.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Handing large data structures</h3>
      
      <p class=L3><font class=arm>armidale</font> is able to efficiently display information from very large data structures
      or models in lists and tables on the client. The technique ensures that only those items that are visible and are 
      needed for smooth scrolling of lists and tables are passed from the server to the client. As a list or table is 
      scrolled by the user, items that are not yet available on the client are displayed as "please Wait...". When the
      user stops scrolling a request is sent to the server for any items that need to be displayed. When the items
      arrive at the client the 'please wait..." messages are replaced with the real data.
      </p>
      
      <h3>armidale messaging</h3>
      
      <p class=L3>The <font class=arm>armidale</font> system uses TCP/IP to pass messages between clients and servers.
      Messages use a simple binary format comprising a 32 bit message length and a set of data items. Data items 
      can be primitive type values such as int, byte, float, double etc., or more complex types like String, Color
      and Font. The <font class=code>armidale.api.context.clientserver.Message</font> class provides an API for
      constructing and interpreting <font class=arm>armidale</font> messages.

    <h2>Sample Application Source Code</h2>
    
      <p class=L2>The commented source code of a simple application can be found
      <a href="simpleapp_source.html">here</a>. In addition, the following
      <font class=arm>armidale</font> classes and packages are a good place to start understanding
      the operation of <font class=arm>armidale</font>.
