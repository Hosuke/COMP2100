  <h1>Demonstration Applications</h1>
  
    <p class=L1>Three demo applications are included with the <font class=arm>armidale</font> distribution. These
    applications are also normally available on the <font class=arm>armidale</font> 
    <a href="http://armidale.anu.edu.au">server</a> at the
    <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au">Australian National University</a>. These applications can be accessed
    using the following URLs in the <a href="launcher.html">armidale launcher</a> (they should be 
    in the launcher bookmarks list after installation).
    </p>
    
  <h2>arm://armidale.anu.edu.au/armidale.test.SimpleApp</h2>
 
    <p class=L2>This is a very simple <font class=arm>armidale</font> application. When started, the following
    window should appear. If you click the button, an event will be sent to the server and recorded in the
    server log. You won't see any action at the client end!
    </p>
        
    <div class="center">
      <a href="images/simpleapp.png" type="image/png"><img src="images/simpleapp-sml.png" width="200" height="106" border="0"/></a>
    </div>

  <h2>arm://armidale.anu.edu.au/armidale.test.guitest.Main</h2>
  
    <p class=L2>This application is a demonstration of the GUI widgets supported by <font class=arm>armidale</font>.
    When started the following window should appear.  The tabs at the top of the window can be used to show each
    of the demonstrated widgets. (NOTE: when connected over the internet, an empty frame will appear first
    followed some time later by all of the widgets. This delay is due to the number of images downloaded and will be
    significantly reduced the second time the applciation is run).
    </p>

    </div>

  <h2>arm://armidale.anu.edu.au/armidale.test.ArmidaleImage</h2>
  
    <p class=L2><font class=arm>armidaleIMAGE</font> is used to evaluate image handling performance.
    It is somewhat inflexible, but could form the basis of a more sophisticated image handling program. 
    When started, <font class=arm>armidaleIMAGE</font> will open a window displaying thumbnail
    images as shown below. When the
    user clicks a thumbnail, a full image is displayed in a new window. <font class=arm>armidaleIMAGE</font>
    looks for images in the <font class=code>demos/armidaleIMAGES</font> directory of the
    <a href="architecture.html#filesystem">armidale filesystem</a>. Thumbnail images are named
    <font class=code>THM*.JPG</font> and full images are named <font class=code>AUT*.JPG</font>
    (this is the naming convention used by Canon digital cameras).
    </p>

    </div>

  <h1>Running the Demo applications locally</h1>
  
    <p class=L1>A features of the <font class=arm>armidale</font> system is that applications can be
    run on a standalone machine. That is, without a server. So, if the <b>armidale.anu.edu.au</b> server
    is unavailable or you don't have internet access for some reason, the following command lines
    can be used to run the demo applications locally on your computer.
    </p>
    
      <p class=L2Code>
        java -cp &lt;install_dir&gt;/jars/armidale.jar armidale.test.SimpleApp
        <br/>
        java -cp &lt;install_dir&gt;/jars/armidale.jar armidale.test.guitest.Main
        <br/>
        java -cp &lt;install_dir&gt;/jars/armidale.jar armidale.test.ArmidaleImage
      </p>

    <p class=L1>Note that when you run <font class=arm>armidaleIMAGE</font> locally, it will open a 
    window as described above, but will not display any thumbnail images because there are none installed
    in your local file system. To reduce the size of the user system, test images are only included
    with the developer system.
