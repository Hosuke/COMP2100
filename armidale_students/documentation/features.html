  <h1>Features</h1>
    
    <p class=redNote>This is section is not complete - the following are just notes
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Applications instead of web pages</h2>
      <p class=L2><font class=arm>armidale</font> supports the development and deployment of applications with
      sophisticated graphical user interfaces. These applications are started from
      the <font class=arm>armidale application launcher</font> in much the same way that web pages are
      opened using web browsers.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L2><font class=arm>armidale</font> applications can be as simple as a static display of images and text (much like
      a basic web page) or as sophisticated as any traditional desktop application.
      </p>
  
    <h2>Universal Application Launcher</h2>
      <p class=L2>To run <font class=arm>armidale</font> applications, a single Java jar file needs to downloaded
      and run (installed). Once installed, the end user can start browsing <font class=arm>armidale</font>
      applications running around the internet or their local intranet.
      </p>
      
      <p class=L2>The <font class=arm>armidale launcher</font> will run on any JDK 1.4 platform (eg. Linux, Solaris, Windows)
      </p>
    
    <h2>Radical Simplicity</h2>
      <p class=L2>no large servers and browsers, simple browser, simple conventional OO programming model, no need at all to
      worry about network issues.
      </p>
      
    <h2>Dynamic management of available applications</h2>
      <p class=L2>applications can be installed and removed without restarting the server
      </p>
      
    <h2>Low bandwidth open communications protocol</h2>
      <p class=L2>Communications based on simple open binary message protocol. low bandwidth, simple API to messaging, faster that XML 
      and just as usable and open.
      </p>
      
    <h2>Platform independance</h2>
      <p class=L2>runs on any JDK 1.4 platform - linux, solaris, windows (Mac soon - when 1.4 released)
      </p>
      
    <h2>Extensible widget set</h2>
      <p class=L2>developer can add new widgets, specified in XML file. armidale will generate all of the code required to distribute
      new widgets. The developer only needs to implement methods used to display the widgets (using swing for example) 
      </p>
      
      <p class=L2>Applications can check for the availability of third party widgets on the client before starting.
      </p>
      
    <h2>Efficient handling of massive data sets</h2>
      <p class=L2>huge data sets can be viewed over network without sending entire data set.
      </p>
      
    <h2>Simple model for new Client Implementations</h2>
      <p class=L2>new client implementation technologies can be added (currently swing is implemented). eg. mobile
      devices.
