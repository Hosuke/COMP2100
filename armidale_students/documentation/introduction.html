  <h2>What is armidale?</h2>
 
    <a name="what"></a> 
    
    <p class=L2><font class=arm>armidale</font> is a set of <a href="http://www.opensource.org">
    open source</a> Java programs and libraries designed to radically simplify the development,
    deployment and use of web applications that have rich graphical user interfaces.
    <font class=arm>Armidale</font> applications are developed using the <font class=arm>armidale API</font>
    as if they were stand-alone programs. They can then be run on stand-alone computers or installed on an
    <font class=arm>armidale</font> server. When installed on a server,
    <font class=arm>armidale</font> applications can be run by clients around the internet
    (or intranet) using the <font class=arm>armidale application launcher</font>. This client launcher
    displays the user interface of <font class=arm>armidale</font> applications running on
    remote servers. A high level, light weight message protocol between the server and its clients
    ensures that <font class=arm>armidale</font> applications respond well to user interaction.
    </p>
    
    <p class=L2>Because <font class=arm>armidale</font> applications are developed using the Java
    programming language, they have access to a wide range of popular database and enterprise
    technologies on many platforms via a simple conventional programming model. This, along with
    the ability to deploy <font class=arm>armidale</font> applications across the internet, ensures that
    <font class=arm>armidale</font> offers a sensible alternative to the myriad of web technologies 
    used to build web pages that try and behave like applications.
    </p>      
    
  <h2>Development Status</h2>
 
    <a name="status"></a> 

    <p class=L2><font class=arm>armidale</font> is at an early, but very usable, stage of development.
    It is hoped that <font class=arm>armidale's</font> <a href="license.html">open source license</a>
    will promote further development by a team of interested developers using the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/armidale"/>sourceforge.net armidale development system.</a>
    </p>
  
  <h2>Why is it called armidale?</h2>

    <a name="name"></a>
    
    <p class=L2>I have always had difficulty identifying catchy and appropriate names for the software 
    I develop. So I've given up. From now on I will name all my software after Australian country
    towns, starting with <a href="http://www.armidale.com">Armidale</a>.
    </p>
  
  
  <h2>What platforms will armidale run on?</h2>
  
    <a name="platforms"></a>
    
    <p class=L2><font class=arm>armidale</font> was developed on SuSE Linux 
    using the Sun Microsystems JDK 1.4.0 and will run on Java 1.3 and 1.4 platforms.
    Testing has been conducted on SuSE and Redhat Linux (Java 1.3 and 1.4), Solaris 8 (Java 1.3), MacOS X (Java 1.3) 
    and Windows 2000 (Java 1.3 and 1.4). The entire system uses standard Java features 
    and should therefore run without problem on any Java 1.3 or 1.4 platform. If you
    do have any problems, please report them
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/armidale">here</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p class=L2>When possible, you should always use Java 1.4.
    </p>
    
  <h2>Quick Start</h2>
  
    <a name="quickstart"></a>
    
    <p class=L2>Start <a href="userinstall.html">here</a> if you want to get started right away. Download the
    <font class=arm>armidale application launcher</font> and start running <font class=arm>armidale</font> 
    applications around the internet.
